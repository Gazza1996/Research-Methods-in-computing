## How will Artificial Intelligence change the world?
#### Abstract
In this paper I will give an in-depth analysis of A.I (Artificial Intelligence). I will go in to detail the many ways that this new, emerging technology can have serious repercussions on our world as we know it today, but also the ways that it can have a very positive affect on our world in the future. A.I is quickly becoming one of the most talked about and popular technology out there with many big tech companies investing heavily in it as they see a future where A.I will be hugely involved. We live in a world where A.I is surrounding us even in places where we aren't even aware.
