\begin{abstract} \newline
In this paper I will give an in-depth analysis of A.I (Artificial Intelligence). I will go in to detail the many ways that this new, emerging technology can have serious repercussions on our world as we know it today, but also the ways that it can have a very positive affect on our world in the future. A.I is quickly becoming one of the most talked about and popular technology out there with many big tech companies investing heavily in it as they see a future where A.I will be hugely involved. We live in a world where A.I is surrounding us even in places where we aren't even aware. \vspace{2mm}

\section{INTRODUCTION}

A.I is the study and creation of machines that would require human intelligence in order to be operational. The main aim of A.I is to produce machines that are capable of making decisions that a human is also capable of. These machines should be able to solve problems, make decisions, hold the same intelligence as a human and learn on its own in initiative. 

Even though A.I has been around for centuries and has been seen in mythological discoveries it has only become popular in the last decade due to increased research and development. Everyones interpretation of A.I is that of a Terminator like robot that will one day become smarter than humans and will be able to control the world and humans could seize to exist. Although this "could" be a possible outcome it most likely would never happen. 

A.I is a very broad area of computer science which is commonly broken into 3 main types: Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. A.I uses algorithms in order to process an operation, an algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a computer is able to execute or to perform an operation.

\section{History of A.I}
%\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}
%\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}
The idea of A.I hasn't just been a new technology thought about in the last few years or decades, this has been an idea that has been around for centuries dating all the way back to the ancient Greeks where there has been prove that they had myths about robots, also Chinese and Egyptian engineers developed automatons. The field of A.I itself wasn't initially founded until 1956 at a conference in Dartmouth College in New Hampshire where the term 'Artificial Intelligence was first mentioned. Many scientists who attended the conference were optimistic about the future of A.I including MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky who is quoted to have said [1]“Within a generation the problem of creating ‘Artificial Intelligence’ will substantially be solved,” from the book “AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence” (Basic Books, 1994). Moving forward from this foundation of 1956, achieving artificial intelligence was not as easy as first thought. After many reports of poor progress in development in A.I, all government funding and any popular interest in the field was dropped from 1974-1980, also known as the “A.I winter”. Later on in the 1980’s the field was refunded by the British government in order to compete with the Japanese efforts to research A.I. Once again a second “A.I winter” occurred from 1987 to 1993. This fall occurred as a reduced amount of government funding and also coinciding with collapse of the early general-purpose computers. 
It wasn’t until 1997 when research picked up again when IBM’s Deep Blue became the first computer to win a game of chess by beating chess champion Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov. In the 1950s a computer scientist and Mathematician by the name of Alan Turing developed a competition to assess whether a machine is intelligent enough as a human. In 2018 the talking computer “chatbot” was able to trick judges into believing that it was a real skin-and-blood human during this Turing test. However this achievement has been dismissed by many A.I experts as they believe that only a third of the judges were fooled by the ‘chatbot’ and always claiming that it also was able to dodge many questions that a human would not be able to. 
In 2011, on an exhibition game of jeopardy, a quiz show, IBM’s question answering system, Watson, managed to defeat the two greatest Jeopardy champions, Brad Rutler and Ken Jennings, by a huge margin. Adding to this, in 2016, AlphaGo won four out of five games of Go, [2]an abstract strategy board game with the aim to surround more territory than your opponent. AlphaGo managed to beat Go champion Lee Sedol becoming the first computer to play the game to beat a professional Go player. In 2017, world number one Go player for two years running Ke Jie lost a three-game match against AlphaGo. These winnings saw the completion of a significant milestone in A.I development as Go is a very complex game, much more complex than chess. 


\section{Types of A.I}

A.I is a very broad concept to deal with it so it can be divided up into different types in order to gain a better understanding of the area of A.I. [3]Although there are various types of A.I to discuss I have decided to talk about the three most important types, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Other types of A.I would include Weak AI, Strong AI and Artificial Superintelligence which simply categorise the different strength levels of A.I used, the more power required for the operation would be decided by choosing one of these types. 

\subsection{Machine Learning} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Neural Network}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Deep Learning}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó
\begin{comment}

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}

\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if you filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
